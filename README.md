# AngularJsFrontEnd
A simple demo for an AngularJS frontend that pulls the last 7 days worth of issues from AngularJS' git

This demo will need to be run from a webserver. Once running the index.html page should initiall display the number of pages containing issues from the last 7 days followed by a drop down list where you can select wich page you would like to view. The page will initially show the first page worth of results by default.
